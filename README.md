## Overview

This repository contains various resources and scripts related to testing and evaluating the performance of the mmp algorithm on top k motif selection with mdl and subspaces.

## Contents

- **Folder "Example Results Subspaces"**: Contains some example output for locations where mmp was tested on top k motif selection with mdl and subspaces.
- **Folder "stumpy"**: Contains the repository with the constrained algorithm.
- **Python Scripts**: Necessary scripts to run the tests. Computations were done in an Anaconda environment. Environment settings can be found in the `environment.yml` file.
- **Preprocessing Information**: Preprocessing was computed with an 11.2 Gb Azure VM with 64 Gigabytes RAM.

## stumpy_24h
For exact computation https://github.com/nembrinj/stumpy_24h needs to be used.

## Environment Setup

To replicate the test environment, ensure you have Anaconda installed and set up the environment using the provided `environment.yml` file.
